Hey there,

with this Trello power up you can get your X1 process board tasks into your Trello board. The button 'X1 configuration' opens the dialog for your X1 server parameter as URL and login data. With the button 'Synch with X1' you can trigger a synchronization of the card with the myX1 process board tasks:

The list 'To-Do', 'In Progress' and 'Completed' will be created automaically if they do not exists on your board.
The cards will be created in the lists, if they do not exists.
The already existeing cards will be updated.
The cards, which were deleted in X1 will be deleted also in Trello.
The leading system is X1, but if the cards will be changed in Trello, they will be updated in X1 (except: card deleted in Trello wont get deleted in X1)
